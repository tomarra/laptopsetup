While this should just be a script it's going to start as a basic list of what and how to setup a new Mac laptop

## MacOS Setup

* Enable all trackpad gestures
* iCloud Login
* Login to Google Account
* MacOS Software Updates
* App Store Updates
* Open up Photo's and turn on iCloud Photo Library
* Open up Messages and turn on iCloud Messages
* Turn on Unlock with Apple Watch
* Finder Settings
* Setup Printer

## App Store Apps

* Todoist
* OneDrive

## External 3rd Party Apps

* [BetterTouchTool](https://bettertouchtool.com)
* 1Password

## Dev Stuff

* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
   * Setup SSH Key and upload to GitHub
* Xcode
   * Need to get this from the Apple Developer portal instead of the App Store. Just gives more flexibility to when and how to update it.
